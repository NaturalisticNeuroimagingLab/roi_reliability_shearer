# Movie-fMRI as an acquisition state for FC-based precision psychiatry

### scripts from the original submission of the manuscript (and my M.Sc thesis) are in the old_scripts directory

### scripts from the revised manuscript are in the ROIs directory and whole_brain directory
- ROIs directory contains scripts for the analysis of three psychiatrically relevant ROIs: L-DLPFC, R-Pre-SMA, L-TPJ.
- whole_brain directory contains scripts for 1) the analysis of every parcel of the brain, treated as an ROI, 2) the analysis of the whole brain parcellated (not included in manuscript)

### See README.md files within each directory for details of the steps of the analyses.
